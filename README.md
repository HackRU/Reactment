> All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them -**Walt Disney**

If you have any questions regarding this task, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We want to help you, and we want you to succeed.

## Technologies
Below is a list of the main technologies Reactment uses:

 - Node.js (npm)
 - React

Feel free to research and gain background knowledge in any of these technologies! Don't hesitate to ask us any questions. Understanding different technologies and how they interact is the key to success.

## What if I don't know React?
This is completely OK! React can be a beast to starters! We didn't choose React for this challenge because we expect everyone to know or learn NodeJS and React, but rather because we needed some language and we simply chose React because its hot right now! Know that part of this task tests how well you operate with different technologies.

## What do I do?
check out the tasks underneath the issues tab, __make sure to assign one to yourself__. perferably you should only do one, but make sure if you do any additional tasks that you assign yorself to them to prevent overlap. feel free to come up with your own ideas too and open an issue or email them to us!

## Difficulty Levels
Every task has a difficulty level assigned to it. We ask that you complete a challenge that accurately represents your knowledge as per the following levels. Every issue is prefixed with a `(x)` where `x` represents the difficulty of the task.

### Level 1
I am a novice at web development, but I can read code. This means that I know at least 1 programming language, and I am willing to learn a lost more, and have an intent to grow!

### Level 2
I know web development, but not React specifically. This means that I know HTML and I know why it doesn't qualify as a valid programming language!

### Level 3
I have experience with web development, and I know React!

## Getting Started
First things first, get rid of those nervous jitters! Take this task as any regular programming task that you have to do either for work or simple fun. Remember that you are contributing to the open source community! No mistake is detrimental here! So make mistakes, but most importantly, have fun doing so!

### 0. Self-assign a task
__make sure you self asign yourself a task if you are doing one on github__ this just ensures no one else accidently works on the same thing as you. you can also feel free to come up with your own idea and email us or open a new issue.

### 1. Clone this repository and branch out
Cloning is easy
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hackru/Reactment.git
cd Reactment
```
We have locked the master branch! Before you can commit any code, you MUST work in a new branch
```bash
git branch <branch name from email>
git checkout <branch name from email>
```

### 2. Install node dependencies
```bash
cd challenge
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```
At this point, your web browser should automatically open up, and you should be able to see this website.

### 4. Poke around the code
Open the code in your favorite IDE! Feel free to poke around the code and make changes. Break the website a couple of times to learn what is actually happening! Once you are comfortable with what is going on, implement the feature or perform the task specified in the email!

### 5. Submit
Once you are done, push your code to github

```bash
git commit -m <Some random message>
git push origin <branch name, you can just use your name or github username>
```

Put in a pull request. Be sure to follow the standard guidelines for pull requests.
