# Welcome: HackRU Reactment Challenge
Welcome to the HackRU Reactment Challenge, RND's community driven interview sandbox. Regardless of whether or not a recruitment task has been emailed to you, feel free to clone this repository and have fun! Everyone is welcome!

## Technologies
Below is a list of the main technologies Reactment uses:

 - Node.js (npm)
 - React

Feel free to research and gain background knowledge in any of these technologies! Once again, don't hesitate to ask us any questions. Understanding different technologies and how they interact is the first step to success.

## What if I don't know React?
This is completely fine! We 100% expect this to be the case for many of you! React can be a beast to starters! But here's a little secret: we didn't choose React for this challenge because we expect everyone to know or learn NodeJS and React, but rather because we needed some language and React was simply the hot choice! Know that part of this task tests how well you operate with and *react* to different technologies.

## Getting Started
First things first, get rid of those nervous jitters! Take this as any regular programming task that you have to do either for work, school, or simple fun. Remember that you are contributing to the open source community! No mistake is detrimental here! So make mistakes, but most importantly, have fun doing so! See the steps below:

### 0. Self-assign a task
Peruse reactment issues [here](https://github.com/HackRU/Reactment/issues). Each issue has an assigned difficulty level (see [below](#task-difficulty-levels) for level definitions). Once you are ready, _self-assign any unassigned and open task_. Once you self assign a task, you __own__ the task (this ensures no one else accidently works on the same thing as you). You can also feel free to come up with your own ideas open a new issue yourself.

### 1. Fork and clone!
Once your have an issue self-assigned, you can now officially get started. Next step is forking. Via Github, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository to your personal account. Once you have it forked, clone it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Reactment.git
cd Reactment
```

### 2. Install node dependencies
At this point, you should have a copy of the code available on your local machine. Time to get into the weeds with react! Next step is to install node dependencies:
```bash
cd challenge
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server
You have everything available to start programming! Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
At this point, your web browser should automatically open up, and you should be able to see this website.

### 4. Poke around the code
Open the code in your favorite IDE. Feel free to poke around the code and make changes. Break the website a couple of times to learn what is actually happening! Once you are comfortable with what is going on, implement the feature or perform the task specified in the issue you self-assigned in step 0.

### 5. Submit
Once you are done, push your code to github

```bash
git commit -m <some random message>
git push origin <branch name, you can just use your name or github username>
```

Put in a pull request from your [forked](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) instance to our main repository under the hackru organization. Be sure to follow the standard guidelines for pull requests.
